# http-status-codes

Constants enumerating the HTTP status codes. Based on the [Java Apache HttpStatus API](http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/HttpStatus.html).

All status codes defined in RFC1945 (HTTP/1.0), RFC2616 (HTTP/1.1), RFC2518 (WebDAV), RFC6585 (Additional HTTP Status Codes), and RFC7538 (Permanent Redirect) are supported.

TypeScript or JavaScript. Completely library agnostic. No dependencies.

## Installation

```console
npm install http-status-codes --save
```

## Usage (express 4.x)

```javascript
var { StatusCodes, ReasonPhrases, getReasonPhrase, getStatusCode } = require('http-status-codes');

response
	.status(StatusCodes.OK)
	.send(ReasonPhrases.OK);

response
	.status(StatusCodes.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
	.send({
		error: getReasonPhrase(StatusCodes.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
	});

response
	.status(getStatusCode('Internal Server Error'))
	.send({
		error: 'Internal Server Error'
	});
```

## Migrating from v1.x.x

If you are migrating from http-status-codes v1 to v2, there are a couple of changes that are
recommended.

1: Rename `getStatusTest()` to `getReasonPhrase()`. The function is otherwise the same.
2: Use selected imports rather than wildcard imports:

*bad*
import * as HttpStatus from 'http-status-codes';

*good*
import { StatusCodes } from 'http-status-codes';

v2 is backwards compatible with v1, but these may be deprecated in a future major version.


## Proposing a new status code

If you'd like to porpose a new status code, feel free to update "codes.json" with the necessary
information and open a pull request. There is no need to modify any source code as it is all
generated based on this file.

In general, we try to include only codes that have an official RFC and have been approved, however
exceptions will be made if the code is already in widespread use in the wild.

## Steps to build and publish

```shell
npm run update-codes
npm run build
npm version [major | minor | patch]
npm run publish
```
